A set of Archlinux source packages for Eth-OS licensed under the AGPLv3.

These PKGBUILDs are not in a standard format so they can't be pushed into
the [AUR](http://aur.archlinux.org). They rely on `$SRCDEST` and `$PKGDEST`
being available to store the source and binary packages and the `PKGBUILD`
build script itself is not auto updated with unneccassary changes that
create useless commits.
