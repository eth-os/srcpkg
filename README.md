A set of [Archlinux] [1] source packages for [Eth-OS] [2] licensed under the
[AGPLv3] [3] with 64bit binary packages available from [here] [4].

These PKGBUILDs are not in a standard format so they can't be pushed into
the [AUR] [5]. They rely on `$SRCDEST` and `$PKGDEST` being available to
store the source and binary packages so that the `PKGBUILD` build scripts
are not auto updated with unneccassary changes that create useless commits.
